### Overview ###
I created a new event object the implements CRUD using REST. The project is based on a charity or fundraiser Walking tracker that allows a user to insert their name, age, gender, a user image, their city, state, the date of the charity walk and how long their walk was in minutes. Using Postman to create, read, update and delete.

## Technologies Used ##
* Spring Tool Suite
* Postman
* REST
* CRUD

## Problems Faced ##
I had trouble with Postman when trying to insert a new user. I accidentally gave the new user its own id but forgot that we had set id to auto increment in MySQLWorkbench.
